🧠 Attendance Management System using Face Recognition


This project is a Python-based desktop application that automates student attendance using face recognition technology. It uses computer vision techniques to detect and recognize faces and marks attendance in real-time. The system is built using OpenCV, Tkinter for GUI, and supports automatic image training and attendance tracking.
